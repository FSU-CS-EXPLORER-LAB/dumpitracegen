DUMPI Trace Generator

Generates synthetic traffic given some parameters
and writes ASCII DUMPI files to reflect the traffic.
.meta file is also written.

Prerequisites:
    Python 2 (2.7 or greater)

Usage:
    dumpitracegen.py config-file config-file-parser output-prefix

    Default configuration file format has lines of job descriptions
        rank-start rank-end number-of-destinations msg-count msg-type  iterations pattern pattern-specific
        ex:
            0         255           3                1024    MPI_CHAR       5      rand          1

    Job ids are assigned sequentially.
    Job ranks are contiguous.
    All jobs start at the same time.

    Output files are ASCII DUMPI traces that can be converted to binary files through ascii2dumpi

Adding new configuration file line formats:
    Add the line parser .py file into the config directory
        Input:
            A formatted line from the config file

        Output:
            {field (str): value (any type)}

    Add the parser into the dictionary inside config/__init__.py

Adding new traffic patterns:
    Add the traffic pattern .py file into the traffic directory
        Input:
            Job dictionary from parser

            Minimum suggested fields:
                start and end ranks
                pattern name
                number of elements and element type (for MPI functions)

        Output
            {source rank (int): [destination ranks (int array)]}

    Add the traffic pattern function into the dictionary inside traffic/__init__.py

    Add the traffic pattern into the necessary parser(s)
