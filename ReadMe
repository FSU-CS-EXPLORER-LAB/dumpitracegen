DUMPI Trace Generator

Generates synthetic traffic given some parameters and writes dumpi
files to reflect the traffic.

Prerequisites:
    Python 2 (2.7 or greater)

Usage:
     dumpitracegen.py config output

     Configuration files have lines of job descriptions
        rank-start rank-end number-of-destinations msg-size iterations pattern count
             0         255           3                1024       5       perm    1

        Job ids are assigned sequentially.
        All jobs start at the same time.

     Output files are ASCII DUMPI traces that can be converted to binary files through ascii2dumpi

Adding new traffic patterns:
    Add the traffic pattern .py file into the traffic directory
    Add the traffic pattern function into the dictionary inside __init__.py

    Each traffic pattern function:
        Input:
            start      = first rank
            end        = last rank
            n          = times to run generator before getting output
            num_dst    = number of communications per iteration
            iterations = number of communications from each rank

        Output
            {job id : {source rank: [destination ranks]}
