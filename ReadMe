DUMPI Trace Generator

Generates synthetic traffic given some parameters
and writes ASCII DUMPI files to reflect the traffic.
.meta file is also written.

Prerequisites:
    Python 2 (2.7 or greater)

Usage:
    dumpitracegen.py config prefix [optional arguments]
        config
            Name of file containing formatted lines of job descriptions

        prefix
            String placed in front of all output filenames

    Output files are ASCII DUMPI traces that can be converted to binary files through ascii2dumpi
    Note: All jobs start at the same time.

Adding new configuration file line parsers:
    Modify the function config.parse_line

Adding new traffic patterns:
    Add the traffic pattern .py file into the traffic directory.
        Input:
            Job dictionary from parser

            Fields that are already available:
                start rank
                end rank
                how many elements to send
                data type of elements
                number of iterations
                traffic pattern name

        Output
            {source rank : [destination ranks]}

    Add the traffic pattern into traffic/__init__.py
