DUMPI Trace Generator

Generates synthetic traffic given some parameters
and writes ASCII DUMPI files to reflect the traffic.
.meta file is also written.

Prerequisites:
    Python 2 (2.7 or greater)

Usage:
    dumpitracegen.py config prefix [optional arguments]
        config
            Name of file containing
                parser name (must be at first valid line)
                followed by formatted lines of job descriptions
            Format should be described in the config/<line parser name>.py comments

        parser
            Must match format of config file lines
            Available values can be found in config/__init__.py

        prefix
            String placed in front of all output filenames

    Output files are ASCII DUMPI traces that can be converted to binary files through ascii2dumpi
    Note: All jobs start at the same time.

Adding new configuration file line parsers:
    Add the line parser .py file into the config directory.
        Input:
            A formatted line from the config file

        Output:
            {field (any type; typically string): value (any type)}

    Add the parser into the dictionary inside config/__init__.py.

Adding new traffic patterns:
    Add the traffic pattern .py file into the traffic directory.
        Input:
            Job dictionary from parser

            Minimum suggested fields:
                start and end ranks
                pattern name
                number of elements and element type (for MPI functions)

        Output
            {source rank (int): [destination ranks (int array)]}

    Add the traffic pattern function into the dictionary inside traffic/__init__.py

    Add the traffic pattern into the necessary parser(s).
